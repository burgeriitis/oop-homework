THE TASK

•	You are free to decide context and task itself (e.g., create an inventory management system for various 2-d shapes)
•	The solution must make use of at least 1 creational GoF pattern, 1 behavioral GoF pattern, and 1 structural GoF pattern.
•	The solution must use at least 4 non-creational GoF patterns in total.

Task implementation 
#Flat reserving system.

For house implementation is used Composite pattern and for creation- Builder.
Flat is using State pattern.
Floor and House is using iterator, to iterate thru lists.
And Service is using strategy pattern, so for this case there could be used repositories with needed behaviour per case.

There is simple implementation of HouseService in Main, to show how this simple flat reserving program works.
