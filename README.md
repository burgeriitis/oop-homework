THE TASK
•	You are free to decide context and task itself (e.g., create an inventory management system for various 2-d shapes)
•	The solution must make use of at least 1 creational GoF pattern, 1 behavioral GoF pattern, and 1 structural GoF pattern.
•	The solution must use at least 4 non-creational GoF patterns in total.

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES
•	Don’t use any input from user at all. If you wish to achieve dynamic behavior, use random numbers.
•	All output should be printed to standard console output.
•	Keep it simple. Your goal is to demonstrate how to implement patterns for your solution, everything else is secondary.
