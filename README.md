# Flat reserving system for houses
#### For OOP homework

For house implementation is used *Composite* pattern and for creation- *Builder*.

Flat is using *State* pattern to set, if flats are free, reserved or bought.

Floor and House is using *Iterator*, to iterate thru lists.

And Service is using *Strategy* pattern, so there could be used repositories with needed behaviour per case.

In this case- it's simple stubbed repository.


There is simple implementation of HouseService in Main, to show how this flat reserving program works.
